# Githubsampleapp
This project is a learning project to implement Github API--using OctoDroid on Android application.
The initial idea of the app:
1. User can log in to his/her Github account
2. User can search repositories
3. Logged in user can view his/her profile & owned/contributed repositories
4. Logged in user can see feed of repositories he/she has or contributing
5. User can search other users and view their profile

##So far the work is on step 2
